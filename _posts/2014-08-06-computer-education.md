With this post I am not trying to publicize any person or any products. But its just because, this video could convey
the feelings that I had during those time when started to like programming and computer.

When the gods in my field are talking then there is nothing left to be said. Truly inspirational for any computer science student.

**UPDATE**: \\
Many people, thinks about what they should have learned about
computer science in their high school; Here is an experience shared at
