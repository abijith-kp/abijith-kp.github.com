Welcome back everyone!!


I have been planning to restart this blog for sometime now. With this new chapter, I wanted to achieve following objectives:
 
- Commitment
- Knowledge sharing
- Evangelizing my work


**Commitment**: Commitment to self to create content which maintains certain quality standards. This will also include the frequency at which the posts are published.


**Knowledge sharing**: A key lesson Iâ€™ve learned recently is the importance of doing hands-on projects to understand new topics. This is inspired from Feynman's famous quote - "What I cannot create, I do not understand".


**Evangelizing my work**: I also wanted to expand on any talks I give. This blog will serve as documentation for these talks. I will also write about insights from any new projects I work on.
